Welcome! My name is **Matheus Saito**, an **Azure Cloud Security Engineer & Architect**. 

This repository serves as a centralized portfolio showcasing my ability to design, deploy, and secure enterprise-grade Azure environments using **Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)**. 

To make it easy for recruiters and hiring managers to review my work without jumping between multiple links, I have consolidated my key project demos into this single repository. Each subfolder represents an isolated, production-ready scenario with its own detailed documentation.

## 💡 Why This Approach?

In real-world enterprise environments, security must be "shift-left" and embedded directly into the deployment pipelines. By utilizing Terraform, I ensure that every environment is:
1.  **Immutable & Reproducible:** Eliminating configuration drift.
2.  **Secure by Default:** Adhering to Zero Trust principles from the first line of code.
3.  **Auditable:** All infrastructure changes are version-controlled and peer-reviewed.
